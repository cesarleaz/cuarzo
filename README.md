### Documentation

Refer to our comprehensive [documentation](https://github.com/gabriedev/cuarzo-docs) for detailed instructions, examples, and usage guides specifically designed for Game Streaming compatibility. Take advantage of the available resources to create attractive and streaming-ready games.

### Example

Discover the power of Cuarzo Engine with our simple example to start creating games quickly and easily! We have several example projects available in the [Cuarzo Engine repository.](https://github.com/gabriedev/cuarzo) Here's a simple starting example:

```js
import { Cuarzo } from 'cuarzo/core'
import { Area2D } from 'cuarzo/node/area2D'
import { Sprite } from 'cuarzo/sprite'

Cuarzo.init()

const character = new Area2D('character') // Create the area for the game character
Sprite('sprite_name', character, 'ruta_a_la_imagen_del_personaje.png') // Create the character's sprite

Cuarzo.onLoaded(() => {
  // Mount the objects in the game area
  Cuarzo.mount([character])
})
```

In this example, the Cuarzo Engine provides you with a minimalist structure to bring your games to life. With just a few lines of code, you can create a relative area that contains a character. Using the **Area2D** module, you can define a container with the properties your character needs to be represented in the game. Then, with the **Sprite** module, you can assign an image to the character to give it a visual appearance.

The Cuarzo Engine is initialized by calling **Cuarzo.init()**, and once all the internal resources are loaded using **Cuarzo.onLoaded()**, you can mount the character in the game area using **Cuarzo.mount([character])**.

This example is just the beginning of what you can achieve with the Cuarzo Engine. Use it as a starting point to create your own 2D games easily and efficiently. We encourage you to explore more in our Cuarzo Engine repository and join our community, where you can receive support, share your creations, and collaborate with other developers.
